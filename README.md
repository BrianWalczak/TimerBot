- `/alarm`: Set an alarm that goes off at a specific date and time.
- `/reminder`: Set a detailed reminder with a title and description.
- `/presets create`: Create a reusable timer preset for future use.

- `/list presets`: View all saved timer presets.
- `/timezone`: Set your time zone for accurate reminders and alarms.
- `/status`: Check the bot’s uptime, memory usage, and server count.
- `/vote`: Support Timer Bot by voting on Top.gg and others!

**Tip:** you can use the `/help` command to view this list at any time!

## Self-Hosting
> [!NOTE]
> **Self-hosting is optional and intended for developers or advanced users who want more control. Most users won't need to self-host.**

> [!WARNING]
> **Before starting the bot, make sure you have a valid `config.json` file containing your configuration (such as your Discord bot token, or PayPal API credentials). For Docker, this file should be placed in the folder you're mounting (e.g., `./data`).**

Prefer to host the bot yourself? Timer Bot is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, and is easy to set up on your own server.

To start, you can download this repository by using the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrianWalczak/TimerBot.git
cd TimerBot
```

### Docker
When hosting Timer Bot, it's highly recommended to run it inside a Docker container to keep it isolated from your main machine.

To do this, start by building the image using the provided `Dockerfile`:
```bash
docker build -t timerbot .
```

Once the image is built, you can run the bot with `docker run` or edit the `docker-compose.yml` template included.

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: timerbot
    container_name: timerbot
    ports:
      - "3000:7000" # Exposes port 7000 from the container to port 3000 on your host (change 3000 if needed)
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/src/app/data # Replace './data' with the path to your local config.json and database files
    environment:
      FILES_LOCATION: /usr/src/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Local Installation
If you prefer to run Timer Bot on your local system, that's fine too! Just make sure that Node.js is properly installed (run `node --version` to check if it exists). If you don't have it installed yet, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Next, install the required dependencies and start the bot:
```bash
npm install
node .
```
